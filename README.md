# Go User Management System

This project is a user management system built with Go, integrating Clerk for authentication and MongoDB for data storage. It provides a robust backend solution for handling user sign-ins, registrations, profile updates, and secure user data management.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration process using Clerk.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profiles, including names, passwords, and other personal information.
- **Data Storage:** MongoDB is used for storing and querying user data efficiently.
- **Security:** Implements best practices for security, ensuring data is protected.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Go (latest version recommended)
- MongoDB
- Clerk account for authentication

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-user-management.git
```

2. **Set up MongoDB**
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your local system or use a MongoDB cloud service.

3. **Configure Clerk**
Sign up for Clerk and create an application to get your API keys. Configure the Clerk SDK with your backend by setting up the environment variables for the Clerk API keys.

4. **Install dependencies**
Navigate to your project directory and install the necessary Go packages.

```bash
go get .

```

### Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your MongoDB connection string and Clerk API keys.

```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdatabase
CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key
```
